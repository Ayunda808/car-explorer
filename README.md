##  Project Description

Car Explorer allows users to:

- View a list of cars from a simulated API (`json-server`)
- Filter cars by body type (e.g., Sedan, SUV)
- Search for a specific make or model
- Add or remove cars from a personal "Favorites" list
- All interactions happen on a single page without reloads

The app showcases dynamic DOM manipulation, array methods, and event handling in JavaScript.
